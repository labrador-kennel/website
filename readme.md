# labrador-kennel.io

This is the source code used to generate the Labrador Kennel website. Ultimately this is a set of PHP tools that generates 
the content of the site from Labrador package READMEs and the contents of their `docs/` folders. If you're looking to 
change the _actual content_ of the website you should be adjusting the individual repo's documentation instead.
